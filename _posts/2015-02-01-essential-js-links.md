There is a ton of learning material about JavaScript on the web,  and as a developer looking to achieve “mastery” in JavaScript, AngularJS and famo.us, I have buried myself under the weight of it, not always able to discern difficult-to-grasp concepts from inept explanations written by, well, parrots. (Who are these parrots? Facile developers who quickly picked up some framework — _I’m looking at you, Angular_ — and who by way of explanation merely mouth the words others taught them without clarifying _why_ something different is different or whether that difference is significant or not).

Of course, my catholic intake of everything Angulared and JavaScripty has led me to lists curated by my elders, the first of which I present here. By “present” I actually mean _re-_present because this list of essential JavaScript links from Eric Elliott was posted as a GitHub gist by Elliott and is not only [still there](https://gist.github.com/ericelliott/d576f72441fc1b27dace title="link to Eric Elliott gist"), it regularly acquires fresh items.

I lack the credentials to dispute Elliott’s choices or to supplement them, but I hope my _re-_presentation is valuable by the addition of my own obsessive labors providing visuals of each link presented and a short summary or description that the site itself provides.

Elliott’s gist list is quickly scanned, despite its length (134 items at the end of January 2015). My bulky rendition is not. Rather the goal is to enable a quicker decision as to which resources to explore first by providing some sense of what each one is about. &nbsp; *—Roger Sperberg*
