title: JavaScripting My Way
post_author: Roger Sperberg
---
The arc describing the change in my work as a developer is bending furiously into JavaScript as I pack away the semantic technologies I have wielded since the dawn of XML.

I've encountered a wicked amount of content on JavaScript, and this site is one way I'm keeping track of everything I run across. And, hopefully, others retracing the same path will find value in the resources identified here as I am JavaScripting my way into the future.

For employment purposes, I seek familiarity with a broad variety of JavaScript libraries. My current path, however, is aimed at using the famo.us JavaScript framework to build fast-as-native mobile iOS and Android apps.

And much of what famo.us demands will contradict the traditional HTML-CSS-JS approach, obviating the need for most of the aforementioned JS libraries.

So as famo.us leads me down the path of inattention to "domanip" (DOM manipulation), of forgoing pages and dropping physics into the most innocuous of designs  — the traditional JavaScript way and my way will likely diverge. As they do, I will document the reasoning here. &nbsp; *—Roger Sperberg*
