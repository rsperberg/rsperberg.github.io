title: The Three JavaScripts
post_author: Roger Sperberg

When JavaScript novices start to learn the language, they don't realize that people telling them what to learn are lumping together three distinct languages under the rubric "JavaScript."

Without fail, when the advice-givers declare that "JavaScript is easy to learn," they are talking about programming mechanics, the seven or so basic components of any programming language: loops, if-then/conditionals, strings, arrays and such-like.

The Codecademy [tutorial](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) is free and often recommended; and the high video production values of Code School's "[JavaScript Road Trip](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript)" (and presumably its other JS courses) make it stand out.[1]



[1] The three levels of Part 1 of JavaScript Road Trip is free to watch, parts 2 and 3 require the $29/monthly membership.
