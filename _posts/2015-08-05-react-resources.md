<p><img src="/media/2015-08-05-react-resources/react-logo.png" width="200px" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px;" />As noted in an <a href="http://www.super-script.us/2015/essential-js-links.html" title="link to post on essential JS links">earlier post</a>, there’s a ton of material to learn about JavaScript, and my approach to mastering it is first to rely on experienced, talented developers to point me in the right direction. In learning React.js, I quickly encountered references to “<a href="https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react" title="link to awesome-react GitHub page">awesome React</a>” as a resource, and I concur, it <em>is</em> awesome — 700 links to React resources, divided into 72 categories. </p>

However, while it is massive and comprehensive it is also an unvariegated listing. So as I have begun to explore what each link offers, I am adding here some contextual information to the ur-source.

That means this list — like  two previous ones I’ve posted on <a href="http://www.super-script.us/2015/essential-js-links.html" title="link to post on essential JS links">JavaScript</a> and <a href="http://www.super-script.us/2015/es6-tools.html" title="link to post on es6 tools">es6</a> (aka es2015) — is a _re_-presentation of someone else’s link list. The “awesome React” list was compiled by the relentless [Nick Raienko](https://twitter.com/enaqx "link to @enaqx twitter page"), who continues to update it.

I have not altered the original list (each link of which is usually characterized only by a single short phrase) except to provide visuals for many links, quote a self-description or summary from the site itself, identify authors when possible and cite some of the GitHub or npm metadata. Any non-quoted description that I myself have added appears in italics and/or within square brackets.

Lots of people use React as the V in MVC. Since React makes no assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, it's easy to try it out on a small feature in an existing project. React abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance.

“[H]ere is my ... walkthrough of rewriting Angular PhoneCat in React. ...

“[This] React version contains 40% more lines of code [than the Angular original]. I’m certain that both the Angular and React versions could have been written more or less succinctly, but succinctness is a non-goal.

“Here’s a rapidly brainstormed list of possibly superior criteria for JS framework selection:

* Learning curve: How high? How steep?
* Productivity: Both initially and over time
* Pre-existing developer familiarity with underlying concepts
* Ease of integration with tools and legacy systems
* Performance considerations
* Re-usability of client code
* Does it encourage high cohesion & low coupling?
* Testability: Unit, Behavioral, Integration, Visual regressions testing
* Server rendering capabilities
* Maintenance burden
* API stability”

“I started thinking about how to optimize the board layout [of Twilight Stuggle] for a smaller screen, which then quickly spiralled out of control into building a playable virtual board because hey, I’m that kind of nerd.

“The file tree in Brackets is a bit complex and I did an experiment to see if I could use React to make it less complex. React’s claim to fame is that its programming model is extraordinarily simple: you tell React how the page should look and behave and React makes it so.

“Note: I’m assuming some basic familiarity with React here, but I’m going to spend most of my words here on how I applied React in this experiment.

“I’ll make it clear up front that React is not the only way to simplify this code. However, much of the complexity around the file tree arises because of the need to synchronize state between the model (file objects and the currently selected file) and the view. That’s exactly the kind of code that just melts away with React.”<br />
