Super-Script is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a database-less site generator, and makes use of the [Cosette](https://github.com/camporez/Thinny/releases) theme designed by [Ian Camporez Brunelli](http://camporez.com/blog/hello-cosette/). The content is located in a repository on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
