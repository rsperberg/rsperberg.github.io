  This is a website by Roger Sperberg about JavaScript and, lo, its many incarnations, particularly famo.us.

It's built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and makes use of the [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme designed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). The content is located in a repository on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
